# PowerGlove prototype

This was a prototype we built to read a gyro and bend sensor mounted to a Nintendo powerglove to control the wrist and claw.

To use:
- download the required libraries (see README in lib/ folder)
- open the PowerGlove project in eclipse
- compile and deploy the code in PowerGLoveArduino (folder up from this in repo) to the powerglove
- run with args: <team number> <com port>

example: `java team3543.powerglove.Main 3453 COM5`

TODO - better docs - this is a hastily written README coming home from the North Bay match.  More details required!  Breadboard schematics, etc.
